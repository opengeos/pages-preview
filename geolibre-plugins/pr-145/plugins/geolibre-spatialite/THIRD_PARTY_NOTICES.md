# Third-Party Notices and Upstream Licensing Information

This document details the copyright notices, licenses, and legal terms governing third-party libraries, algorithms, and upstream projects integrated into, referenced by, or distributed with **GeoLibre SpatiaLite Engine** (`geolibre-spatialite`).

---

## 1. Primary License & Architecture Policy

**GeoLibre SpatiaLite Engine** is developed by **Outer Loop Consulting** and released under the **GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 2.1 or later** (`LGPL-2.1-or-later`). See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the full text of the LGPL 2.1.

### 1.1 Upstream Tri-License Election
Upstream **SpatiaLite** (`libspatialite`) is tri-licensed under:
- The **Mozilla Public License (MPL)**, Version 1.1 or later,
- The **GNU General Public License (GPL)**, Version 2.0 or later, or
- The **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)**, Version 2.1 or later.

Under this tri-license structure, **Outer Loop Consulting** explicitly elects the **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), Version 2.1 or later** for `geolibre-spatialite`.

### 1.2 Isolation from GPL Copyleft (`librttopo` Exclusion Policy)
Upstream `libspatialite` includes optional integrations with `librttopo` (the RTTopology library derived from PostGIS). `librttopo` is strictly licensed under **GPL-2.0-or-later** (without Lesser GPL exceptions). 

To prevent viral copyleft from forcing GPL terms onto the entire compiled binary and compromising compatibility with permissive consumer plugins:
- **`geolibre-spatialite` strictly excludes `librttopo`** (configured via `--disable-rttopo` in all C/WASM build scripts and CI pipelines).
- No GPL-only code is incorporated into the distribution.
- This ensures the distributed engine remains cleanly under **LGPL-2.1-or-later**.

### 1.3 Consumer Plugins & LGPL 2.1 Section 5/6 Compliance
Under Section 5 and Section 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1:
- A separate application or plugin (such as the **AequilibraE** GeoLibre plugin, which is licensed under the permissive **MIT License**) that communicates with `geolibre-spatialite` via documented public interfaces (`window.geolibreSpatialite` or GeoLibre's service registry `app.getService('spatialite')`) constitutes a **"work that uses the Library"**.
- Such consumer plugins **remain independent works** and may be licensed under terms of their authors' choice (including the MIT License or commercial terms).
- Users receive the complete source code of `geolibre-spatialite` within every distributed plugin ZIP under `source/`, allowing them to modify, recompile, and relink `geolibre-spatialite` at will using `npm ci && npm run build`.

## 8. Geodesic Algorithms

The geodesic calculations implemented in `src/spatialite/geodesic.ts` (Vincenty's inverse and direct formulae on the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid) are based on public-domain mathematical formulations published by Thaddeus Vincenty (1975):
* *Vincenty, T. (1975). "Direct and Inverse Solutions of Geodesics on the Ellipsoid with Application of Nested Equations", Survey Review, XXIII (176): 88–93.*

## 9. Dependency Tracking

Full dependency license files are bundled into every released plugin package under `licenses/`:
- `licenses/sql.js.txt`
- `licenses/proj4.txt`
- `licenses/mgrs.txt`
- `licenses/wkt-parser.txt`
- `licenses/libspatialite.txt`
- `licenses/geos.txt`
- `licenses/proj.txt`
- `licenses/zlib.txt`

The exact installed package and native component versions are captured in `DEPENDENCIES.json`. `NATIVE_BUILD_INFO.json` records the native artifacts and their hashes. Plugin source/build inputs are under `source/`; corresponding upstream native source archives are under `sources/` and `source/src/wasm/sources/`. Rebuild the C runtime with `npm run build:wasm` (Docker/Buildx required), then run `npm run check` and package the result. A plain JavaScript rebuild reuses the included native artifacts.

The native build also links zlib 1.3.1 (Jean-loup Gailly, Mark Adler, and contributors), under the zlib license. Its original license text is included in `licenses/zlib.txt` and its complete source archive is included with the native sources.
